/*Q 1: HW02: Create a package name "hw2JavaBasics"
 *    Now use another syso to print your car each info 
 *    (color, model, year, wheel drive [example:4WD], etc. 
 *    [you can add more if you want]) in a separate line
 *     [try to follow how to copy and paste a line in IDE by keyboard command]. 
 *     Use print() instead of print.ln() for the car feature when printing, 
 *     use \n and \t at least once anywhere in the class. 
 *     organize code at the end (very important),
 *      After completing the code, paste it below.
